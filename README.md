Network topology discovery via SNMP and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)

WARNING - This tool needs a rewrite!!!

* If you are looking for a human usable Python snmp library, use [hnmp](https://github.com/trehn/hnmp).

TODO
====

* Implement some kind of loop prevention (based on serial number?, assume hostnames are unique?, ...)
* Add LLDP support
* Rename the tool. Hint: Depends on previous point
* SNMP v3 support
